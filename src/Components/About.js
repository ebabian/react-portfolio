                        I'm a Brooklyn, New York native, avid soccer player, and a big cooking fan. As a non-traditional computer science student at Gerenal Assembly I took the Software Engineering Immersive in order to make a career shift and demystify software engineering for myself. I absolutely love software engineering because I can combine my passions of visual design (I have a BA in Photography), critical thinking (I always feel like Iâ€™m solving a puzzle), and collaboration (I love getting to know all the diverse people that have taught themselves to code and the supportive online community). As a Software Engineering Fellow with a 4.0 GPA, I was hired as a Software Engineer Instructional Associate by General Assembly.
